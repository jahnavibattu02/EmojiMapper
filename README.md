Emoji Mapping based on the emotion of the user

Introducing the Emoji Mapping Project, a revolutionary system that employs the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect user emotions and map them to corresponding emojis. With this system, users will be required to register their details and create a login during registration.

Upon login, the user will be prompted to take a selfie, which will be analyzed by the CNN algorithm to detect their emotions. The detected emotion will then be mapped to the corresponding emoji and displayed to the user.

The system also incorporates a database that stores users' details, including their registered images and their corresponding emotions. This database ensures that the system can learn and improve its accuracy over time.

This system is a significant step forward in enabling individuals to express their emotions in a more interactive and engaging way. With its advanced CNN algorithm and database, users can have confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the mapping process.

The Emoji Mapping Project is a perfect solution for those who struggle to express their emotions through text and can be used in a wide range of applications, including messaging apps, social media platforms, and more. It's a fun and exciting way to enhance communication and bring a smile to everyone's face!
